[In this notebook](./mlflow-train.ipynb) we do some "local" training and we log the metrics to AMLS but we use the MLflow APIs.  AMLS is really a superset of MLflow but in many regards the data science community has landed on MLflow for model management.  In this notebook we look at how we can leverage AMLS as a PaaS-style offering for MLflow.  You can even use AMLS as the MLflow endpoint for training you do in AWS and GCP.  

Open this notebook in your AMLS Compute target or vscode using Remote-SSH development, or anywhere you have AMLS SDK installed.

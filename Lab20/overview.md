As a team, we want to complete the following tasks:

1. Using [MLOpsPython](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOpsPython) as a template, create an Azure DevOps pipeline (or gh action) that creates and runs an Azure ML pipeline to train, validate, and register a model based on your training scripts.

    You may wish to work through the MLOpsPython [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOpsPython/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md) before tackling this task.

    Follow the [bring your own code guide](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOpsPython/blob/master/docs/custom_model.md) to integrate your scripts with the MLOpsPython repository.

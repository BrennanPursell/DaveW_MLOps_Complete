## Lab 1:  Workshop Setup

### Discussion topics before we start this section  

* We use `bash` and `az cli` commands throughout this lab.  What is your comfort level with bash? 
* Why do we need to do "resource prefixing"?  
* What is your preferred IDE?  I like to use vscode
* Cloud Shell overview?  
* What is your git experience?  
* To speed up Azure deployments we use ARM Templates.  What is your experience?  


We are going to deploy the following to Azure : 
* 1 Storage account
* 1 Data Factory
* 1 Databricks workspace
* 1 SQL Server
* 1 SQL database


### Prerequisites

* We will use `bash` and `az cli` commands throughout the workshop.  You can use Powershell as an alternative, but the commands will be different.  

* You **will need** an Azure account with at least one Resource Group with owner permissions.  

> Note: If you don't have an account you can create your free Azure account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).  **But we aware that free trial accounts do not always allow every Azure service to be spun up and utilized.**


### On Your Local Laptop...

you'll likely need the following, which can be installed now or as we progress through the workshop:

* [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/features/storage-explorer/)
* vscode
* Clone this GitHub repository using Git and the following commands: 

    `git clone https://github.com/davew-msft/MLOps-E2E`
* I prefer to use WSL in Windows but Azure Cloud Shell is fine.  If you do NOT want to use Cloud Shell then you'll need the following:
  * [Azure CLI Installer (MSI) for Windows](https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCliWindows)
  * or the WSL/Linux version


### Deploy Resources to Azure

You need one resource group.  

* Suggested name (used throughout this workshop):  `MLOpsWorkshop`.  
* Suggested region:  `East US 2`.



Run the following to create the RG using Cloud Shell:

``` bash
#vars/changeme
ResGroup='MLOpsHackathon'
Subscription='davew'
location='eastus2'

# ensure you are connected to the desired subscription
az account list --output table
az account set --subscription "$Subscription"
az account list --output table

az group create --name $ResGroup --location $location
```

Now we need to provision our resources using the ARM templates.  

I assume Cloud Shell.  Here's the steps:  

```bash
# clone the repo first in your cloud shell
mkdir -p git && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/davew-msft/MLOps-E2E mlops
cd mlops

az deployment group create \
    -g $ResGroup \
    --template-file setup/azureclideploy.json \
    --parameters setup/parameters.json

# check that everything deployed successfully
az resource list -g $ResGroup -o table
```

This may take some time.  

|Questions|
|----------|
|Do you know how to check the status of your deployment? |
|Why is your deployment named `azureclideploy` in the Azure Portal?|
|How can you ensure everything deployed successfully, even if there was failure the first time? |
|How can we delete all resources at the end of the day? |

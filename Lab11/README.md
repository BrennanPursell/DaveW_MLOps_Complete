## Lab 11:  Let's Build a Basic Model

In this lab a data scientist builds a basic model without any AMLS integration.  


### Discussion topics before we start this section  

1. Make sure AMLS is spun up.  
1. To run your notebooks in the workspace, create a **Compute Instance** and wait for it to start.
    * Why do our work via remote compute? 
1. Make sure your kernel is set to **Python 3.6 - AzureML** 
## Step 1:  Train a Model

First we are going to do the absolutely minimum to get a training environment and trained model working with our use case.  

1. Navigate to [Lab11/safe-driver-prediction.ipynb](./Lab11/safe-driver-prediction.ipynb). 
    * this is a basic notebook that trains and validates a model.  
    * upload this file to your JupyterLab environment or open it from JupyterLab if you cloned the repo.  
1. Walk through each cell in the notebook.
